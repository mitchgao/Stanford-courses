    "In this chapter we describe a class of learning methods that was developed separately in different fields -- statistics and artificial intelligence -- based on essentially identical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The central idea is to extract linear combinations of the inputs as derived features, and then model the target as a nonlinear function of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a powerful learning method, with widespread applications in many fields."
