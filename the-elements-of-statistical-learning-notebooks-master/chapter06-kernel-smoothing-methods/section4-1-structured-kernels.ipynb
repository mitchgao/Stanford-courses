    "One line of approach is to modify the kernel. The default spherical kernel\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "gives equal weight to each coordinate, and so a natural default strategy is to standardize each variable to unit standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general approach is to use a positive semidefinite matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ to weigh the different coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "K_{\\lambda,\\mathbf{A}}(x_0,x) = D \\left( \\frac{(x-x_0)^T\\mathbf{A}(x-x_0)}\\lambda \\right).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Entire coordinates or directions can be downgraded or omitted by imposing appropriate restrictions on $\\mathbf{A}$. For example, if $\\mathbf{A}$ is diagonal, then we can increase or decrease the influence of individual predictors $X_j$ by increasing or decreasing $A_{jj}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the predictors are many and highly correlated, such as those arising from digitized analog signals or images. The covariance function of the predictors can be used to tailor a metric $\\mathbf{A}$ that focuses less, say, on high-freqeuncy contrast (Exercise 6.4)."

    "### Structured regression over general models for $\\mathbf{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposals have been made for learning the parameters for multidimensional kernels. For example, the projection-pursuit regression model discussed in Chapter 11 is of this flavor, where low-rank versions of $\\mathbf{A}$ imply ridge functions for $\\hat{f}(X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More general models for $\\mathbf{A}$ are cumbersome, and we favor instead the structured forms for the regression function discussed next."
