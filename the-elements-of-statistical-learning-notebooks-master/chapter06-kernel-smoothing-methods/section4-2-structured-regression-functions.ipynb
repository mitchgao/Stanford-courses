    "### Backfitting\n",
    "In Chapter 9, we describe iterative _backfitting_ algorithms for fitting such lower-order interaction models. In the additive model, for example, if all but the $k$th term is assumed known, then we can estimate $g_k$ by local regression of $Y - \\sum_{j\\neq k}g_j(X_j)$ on $X_k$. This is done for each function in turn, repeatedly, until convergence. The important detail is that at any stage, 1D local regression is all that is needed. The same ideas can be used to fit low-dimensional ANOVA decompositions."

Here we model the $\\textsf{diameter}$ of the aorta as a linear function of $\\textsf{age}$, but allow the coefficients to vary with $\\textsf{gender}$ and $\\textsf{depth}$ down the aorta. We used a local regression model separately for males and females. Wile aorta clearly does thicken with age at the higher regions of the aorta, the relationship fades with distance down the aorta.
