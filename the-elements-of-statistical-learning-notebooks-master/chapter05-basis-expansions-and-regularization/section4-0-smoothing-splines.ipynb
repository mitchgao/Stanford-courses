    "Consider the two special cases:\n",
    "1. $\\lambda = 0$: $f$ can be any function that interpolates the data.\n",
    "2. $\\lambda = \\infty$: the simple least squares line fit, since no second derivative can be tolerated.\n",
    "\n",

    "The above $\\text{RSS}$ is defined on an infinite-dimensional function space -- in fact, a Sobolev space of functions for which the second term is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, it can be shown that for the $\\text{RSS}$ there is an explicit, finite-dimensional, unique minimizer which is a natural cubic spline with knots at the unique values of the $x_i$, $i=1,\\cdots,N$ (Exercise 5.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "At face value it seems that the family is still over-parametrized, since there are as many as $N$ knots, which implies $N$ degrees of freedom. However, the penalty term translates to a penalty on the spline coefficients, which are shrunk some of the way toward the linear fit."
