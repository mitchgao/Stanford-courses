    "In practice this can be achieved by simple numerical methods. So, for example, in $\\textsf{R}$ one can use $\\textsf{smooth.spline(x,y,df=6)}$ to specify the amount of smoothing. This encourages a more traditional mode of model selection, where we might try a couple of different values of $\\text{df}$, and select one based on approximate $F$-tests, residual plots and other more subjective criteria. Using $\\text{df}$ in this way provides a uniform approach to compare many different smoothing methods. It is particularly useful in _generalized additive models_ (Chapter 9), where several smoothing methods can be simultaneously used in one model."
