Furthermore if random variables $Z_1, Z_2, \\cdots, Z_N$ are white noise, the expected maximum $|Z_j|$ for $j=1,\\cdots,N$ is approximately $\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\log N}$. Hence all coefficients below $\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\log N}$ are likely to be noise and are set to zero.\n",

    "For the NMR data in the upper panel, the smoothing spline introducees detail everywhere in order to capture the detail in the isolated spike; the wavelet fit nicely localizes the spike. In the lower panel, the true function is smooth, and the noise is relatively high.
