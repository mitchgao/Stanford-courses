    "\n",
    "For example, for signal or image recognition a popular approach is to first transform the raw features via a wavelet transform ($\\S$ 5.9) and then use the features as inputs into a neural network (Chapter 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Wavelets are effective in capturing discrete jumps or edges, and the neural network is a powerful tool for constructing nonlinear functions of these features for predicting the target variable. By using domain knowledge to construct appropriate features, one can often improve upon a learning method that has only the raw features $x$ at its disposal."
