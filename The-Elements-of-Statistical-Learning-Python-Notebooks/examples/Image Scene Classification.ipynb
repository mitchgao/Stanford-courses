The aim is to predict this classification, given the multi-spectral values. In the sample database, the class of a pixel is coded as a number.\n",

Thus, the four spectral values for the central pixel are given by attributes 17,18,19 and 20. If you like you can use only these four attributes, while ignoring the others.
